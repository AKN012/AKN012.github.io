                Andre's Elementary Life was when he awakened his love for Mathematics,
                Computers, and anything logical. This was also the time where he 
                still had some of his baby fat ðŸ˜…. Judging by the pictures Andre certainly
                changed a lot. He was doing average is his first years, it was dull and uneventful
                the only mermory Andre has of those years was when he broke his arm in Grade 2. 
                After all that happend Andre discovered his passion in Grade 4 and it led to
                where he is today. ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©
