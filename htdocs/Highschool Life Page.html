                Andre's Highschool Life is helping Andre discover new
                and interesting things. Andre is still in Highschool
                as of now and is still trying his best to perform well.
                He spent his first 2 years in highschool in online classes,
                which Andre hated. At Grade 9, which is also his current 
                grade level, he began to make friend with not only his classmates,
                but also with batchmates, some teachers, and even some of his 
                dormmates ü•∞. He has lost alot of weight and also grew taller 
                while in the pandemic üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
