        <article id="textAboutMyself">
            <p> Andre is 14 years old currently, his birthday was in 
                May 30, 2008. His house as of today is in Miagao, Iloilo.
                His favorite food is a square pizza with hot sauce. He
                was previously introverted but he turned into an extrovert
                after realizing that spending time with other people makes
                him happier than when he is alone.
            <br>
            <br>
                In his opinion, he is a hardworking student in that he didnt have 
                a late submission in this First Quarter (1st Quarter) (yet)... ðŸ‘€. 
                He also has alot of supportive friends, even if they dont help much 
                in group activities from elementary to highschool, he is grateful for 
                every single one of them for being there when he was sad, happy, nervous, 
                and excited.
            <br>
            <br>
                More importantly, he likes pineapple on pizza ðŸ˜ˆ
