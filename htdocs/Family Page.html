            <p> 
                Andre is very happy and grateful to have such a caring and supportive
                family. He is the big brother of the house but his little brother
                is much more responsible and obedient than Andre ðŸ˜…. Andre's Mother
                is both caring and loving but this doesnt mean you should test her patience
                ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥². The father on the other hand is very smart and strong, he is Andre's
                idol and also his teacher. Lastly, the live-in-cousin, she is the righthand 
                woman to my mother in house hold chores, she can be inefficient and lazy sometimes
                but she can be reliable.  
            <br>
            <br>
                Andre and his family is very chaotic sometimes, they can get into fights but 
                their connection is strong. The family will support each other unconditionally and 
                Andre doesn't want it any other way. ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
